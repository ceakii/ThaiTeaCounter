TODO (high to low priority):
- Implement adding data to table
	- Service methods
		- history
			- Getter fxns
			- Setter fxns
- Implement removing data to table
	- Idea: Add column that you can check to remove when decrementing table
	- Service method that updates history and cookie
- Need to add Time Component from Angular Material in Home Component
- Add logic to convert Date, Time, and Place into more presentable view
	- Ex: 06_09_25 => 06/09/2025
	- Ex: 12_00 => 12:00
	- Ex: Tapioca_Express => Tapioca Express
- Add sort feature to Table
- Finish designing Table modal
- Need to finish making Table responsive (the table keeps stretching and introducing a horizontal scroll)
- Readjust placement of Counter and Thai Tea Picture instead of hard-coding it

Current Changes:
- Switched from utilizing cookies to Dexie database for storing Counter and Thai Tea Data
	- Removed ngx-cookie-service
- Database contains 2 stores: counter and history
	- counter stores different thai tea counters (only 1 counter supported right now)
	- history stores list of thai teas and related stats like price, place, etc.
- Implemented Getter/Setter for counter
- Added Observable to reload counter from DB into page view on load
