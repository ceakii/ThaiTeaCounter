TODO (high to low priority):
- Implement removing data to table
	- TODO: Table needs to re-render after deleting item
- Implement modifying data in the table
- Need to add Time Component from Angular Material in Home Component
- Add logic to convert Date, Time, and Place into more presentable view
	- Ex: 06_09_25 => 06/09/2025
	- Ex: 12_00 => 12:00
	- Ex: Tapioca_Express => Tapioca Express
- Add sort feature to Table
- Finish designing Table modal
- Need to finish making Table responsive (the table keeps stretching and introducing a horizontal scroll)
