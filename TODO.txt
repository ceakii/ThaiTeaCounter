TODO (high to low priority):
- Add reset data button
	- Add dialog to confirm reset
- Add a way to delete a specific thai tea
- Finish designing Table modal
- Need to finish making Table responsive (the table keeps stretching and introducing a horizontal scroll)
- Make horizontal view of thai tea counter

Current Changes:
- Properly refactored Observeables in DB.service and History component
- Exported singleton instance of DB instead of declaring new private DB for each component
- Implemented table pagination in history
- Adjusted history table container so table doesn't overflow the dialog
- Implemented table sorting (click a header to sort)
