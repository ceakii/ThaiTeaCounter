TODO (high to low priority):
- Add pagination to table since table is capped around 8 before it stretches into oblivion
- Add sort feature to Table
- Finish designing Table modal
- Need to finish making Table responsive (the table keeps stretching and introducing a horizontal scroll)
- Make horizontal view of thai tea counter

Current Changes:
- Adding/Removing data to history automatically updates counter respectively
- Incrementing the counter adds default data to history
- Decrementing the counter removes last data from history
- Submitting the Thai Tea Form adds specific data to history and updates counter respectively
- Removed time property from history (time is in date)
