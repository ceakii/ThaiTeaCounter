TODO (high to low priority):
- Send data from ThaiTeaForm to DB and Table
- Add logic to convert Date, Time, and Place into more presentable view
	- Ex: 06_09_25 => 06/09/2025
	- Ex: 12_00 => 12:00
	- Ex: Tapioca_Express => Tapioca Express
- Add sort feature to Table
- Finish designing Table modal
- Need to finish making Table responsive (the table keeps stretching and introducing a horizontal scroll)
- Readjust placement of Counter and Thai Tea Picture instead of hard-coding it

Current Changes:
- Renamed Dialog component to History
- Created new dialog component called "ThaiTeaForm" that allows users to add specific thai tea to history
- Added Datepicker, Timepicker, and Input material components to ThaiTeaForm modal
- Replaced old Datepicker component on Home page with new button that opens ThaiTeaForm dialog
- Styled ThaiTeaForm modal
- Implemented Input logic in ThaiTeaForm (Not connected to other components yet***)
