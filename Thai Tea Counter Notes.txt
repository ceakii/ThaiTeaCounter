TODO (high to low priority):
- Add logic to convert Date, Time, and Place into more presentable view
	- Ex: 06_09_25 => 06/09/2025
	- Ex: 12_00 => 12:00
	- Ex: Tapioca_Express => Tapioca Express
- Implement adding data to table
	- Service method that updates history and cookie
	- Need to add Date Component from Angular Material
	- Need to add Time Component from Angular Material
- Implement removing data to table
	- Idea: Add column that you can check to remove when decrementing table
	- Service method that updates history and cookie
- Add sort feature to Table
- Finish designing Table modal
- Need to finish making Table responsive (the table keeps stretching and introducing a horizontal scroll)
- Readjust placement of Counter and Thai Tea Picture instead of hard-coding it

Current Changes:
- Changed toolbar's font from local font to global font for whole app
- Updated Table modal
- Implemented service to get and pass thai tea data between components
- Implemented storing data logic
	- User data is stored in delimited string in thaiTeaHistory cookie
	- Service converts string into ThaiTeaData for easy data manipulation
- Added div to home component for getting input from user
	- Located between Toolbar and Counter
- Modified CSS for buttons
	- All buttons (unless overwritten) share a default global width and height
- Fixed thai tea image and counter so they stay fixed in the center
- Toolbar no longer variably expands its width
- Added box shadows to Toolbar and Input Box
